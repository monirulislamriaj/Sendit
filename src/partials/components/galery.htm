            so
            beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
            pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.</p>
